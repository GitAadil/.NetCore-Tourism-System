Scenario


Asia   Pacific   Tourism   Association–   APTA   (http://apta.asia/)  would   like   organize   a   series   of
conferences focusing on research topics in the area of travel and tourism. As a part of their
operation, they need to organize annual conferences for researchers and industry practitioners to
meet and present their work in 2018. You are appointed as an analyst programmer to develop a
system to support the conference organization of APTA.
Your task is to investigate the operation of APTA and identify potential events or conferences
through the provided link or any other resources available online. You will design and develop a
conference management system for APTA that allows conference organizers to manage the events
and registrations. The system should store conference/event details, organizers details for each
conference, attendee details and their event registration.
Model Design Requirements
You are going to design a model to store data for your application with the following 
specification:
You have freedom to design your own data architecture and properties for the classes, 
however it should reflect your understanding about complex entity relationships, 
including one to one‐‐, one to many‐‐, many to many‐‐, and inheritance.
The application should store information for every class and relationship. Inheritance 
should be used to model classes with similar properties. For example, human being class 
may have common properties such as ID, Name, Contact details (email, phone, address, 
etc...). Besides, each unique class should also have its own properties. You should provide 
justification in your report, on the proposed classes, properties and their relationships 
stating why they are necessary.
Appropriate data annotations and input validations should be provided in all model 
classes.
